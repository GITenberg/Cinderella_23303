<h1>CINDERELLA:</h1>

<p class="center">OR,</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER.</h2>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>There was, many years ago, a gentleman who had a charming lady for his
wife. They had one daughter only, who was very dutiful to her parents.
But while she was still very young, her mamma died, to the grief of her
husband and daughter. After a time, the little girl&#8217;s papa married another
lady. Now this lady was proud and haughty, and had two grown-up daughters
as disagreeable as herself; so the poor girl found everything at home
changed for the worse.</p>

<p>But she bore all her troubles with patience, not even complaining to her
father, and, in spite of her hard toil, she grew more lovely in face and
figure every year.</p>

<p>Now the King&#8217;s son gave a grand ball, and all persons of quality were
invited to it. Our two young ladies were not overlooked. Nothing was now
talked of but the rich dresses they were to wear.</p>

<p>At last the happy day arrived. The two proud sisters set off in high
spirits. Cinderella followed them with her eyes until the coach was out
of sight. She then began to cry bitterly. While she was sobbing, her
godmother, who was a Fairy, appeared before her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/img4.jpg" width="390" height="550" alt="Sisters" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>
&ldquo;Cinderella,&rdquo; said the Fairy, &ldquo;I am your godmother, and for the sake of
your dear mamma I am come to cheer you up, so dry your tears; you shall go
to the grand ball to-night, but you must do just as I bid you. Go into the
garden and bring me a pumpkin.&rdquo; Cinderella brought the finest that was
there. Her godmother scooped it out very quickly, and then struck it with
her wand, upon which it was changed into a beautiful coach. Afterwards,
the old lady peeped into the mouse-trap, where she found six mice. She
tapped them lightly with her wand, and each mouse became a fine horse. The
rat-trap contained two large rats; one of these she turned into a
coachman, and the other into a postilion. The old lady then told
Cinderella to go into the garden and seek for half-a-dozen lizards.
These she changed into six footmen, dressed in the gayest livery.</p>

<p>When all these things had been done, the kind godmother touching her with
her wand, changed her worn-out clothes into a beautiful ball-dress
embroidered with pearls and silver. She then gave her a pair of glass
slippers, that is, they were woven of the most delicate spun-glass, fine
as the web of a spider.</p>

<p>When Cinderella was thus attired, her godmother made her get into her
splendid coach, giving her a caution to leave the ball before the clock
struck twelve.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/img7.jpg" width="387" height="550" alt="The Prince" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On her arrival, her beauty struck everybody with wonder. The gallant
Prince gave her a courteous welcome, and led her into the ball-room;
and the King and Queen were as much enchanted with her, as the Prince
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span>conducted her to the
supper-table, and was too much occupied in waiting
upon her to partake of anything himself. While seated, Cinderella heard
the clock strike three-quarters past eleven. She rose to leave, the Prince
pressing her to accept an invitation for the ball on the following
evening.</p>

<p>On reaching home, her godmother praised her for being so punctual, and
agreed to let her go to the next night&#8217;s ball.</p>

<p>Although she seemed to be tired, her sisters, instead of showing pity,
teased her with glowing accounts of the splendid scene they had just left,
and spoke particularly of the beautiful Princess. Cinderella was delighted
to hear all this, and asked them the name of the Princess, but they
replied, nobody knew her. So much did they say in praise of the lady, that
Cinderella expressed a desire to go to the next ball to see the Princess;
but this only served to bring out their dislike of poor Cinderella still
more, and they would not lend her the meanest of their dresses.</p>

<p>The next evening the two sisters went to the ball, and Cinderella also,
who was still more splendidly dressed than before. Her enjoyment was even
greater than at the first ball, and she was so occupied with the Prince&#8217;s
tender sayings that she was not so quick in marking the progress of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">
<img src="images/img9.jpg" width="392" height="550" alt="Fleeing at midnight" title="" />
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To her alarm she heard the clock strike twelve. She fled from the
ball-room; but in a moment the coach changed again to a pumpkin, the
horses to mice, the coachman and postilion to rats, the footmen to
lizards, and Cinderella&#8217;s <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span>
beautiful dress to her old shabby clothes. In
her haste she dropped one of her glass slippers, and reached home, out of
breath, with none of her godmother&#8217;s fairy gifts but one glass slipper.</p>

<p>When her sisters arrived after the ball, they spoke in terms of rapture of
the unknown Princess, and told Cinderella about the little glass slipper
she had dropped, and how the Prince picked it up. It was evident to all
the Court that the Prince was determined if possible, to find out the
owner of the slipper; and a few days afterwards a royal herald proclaimed
that the King&#8217;s son would marry her whose foot the glass slipper should be
found exactly to fit.</p>

<p>This proclamation caused a great sensation. Ladies of all ranks were
permitted to make a trial of the slipper; but it was of no use. Cinderella
now said, &ldquo;Let me try&mdash;perhaps it may fit me.&rdquo; It slipped on in a moment.
Great was the vexation of the two sisters at this; but what was their
astonishment when Cinderella took the fellow slipper out of her pocket!</p>

<p>At that moment the godmother appeared, and touched Cinderella&#8217;s clothes
with her wand. Her sisters then saw that she was the beautiful lady they
had met at the ball, and, throwing themselves at her feet, craved her
forgiveness.</p>

<p>A short time after, she was married to the Prince, to the intense
gratification of the whole Court.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
